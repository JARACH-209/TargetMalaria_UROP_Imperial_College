### [Target-Malaria Group](https://targetmalaria.org) in Austin-Burt Lab, Imperial College London

## Objectives Covered
* • Exploratory Data Analysis
  * SNPs Filtering Statistics 
  * Minor Allele Filtering - Exploring the right MAF threhsold for rare allele filtering while preserving private alleles
  * Unsupervised exploration - PCA and UMAP visualizations for 4.8 Million SNPs and sampples from 16 populations. UMAP hyperparameter tunining for chromosome arm 3R.
* • Classification of 13 Populations
  * Pipeline for population classification using genetic sequences
  * Futher improvement through dimensionality reduction and domain related techniques
* • Pairwise analysis of 66 population pairs
* • Exploring SNP contribution and importance for population differentiation
* • Generic Python functions to reproduce and automate most of the analyses
